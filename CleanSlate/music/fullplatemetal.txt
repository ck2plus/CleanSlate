# Full Plate Metal by Tobias Gustafsson.
# Outfit your dynasty with the power to rock! Due to popular demand, a new pack of metal music is now available for Crusader Kings II. From Tobias Gustavsson, composer of “Viking Metal” and “Guns, Drums and Steel,” five completely original compositions have been created to add intensity to your Crusader Kings experience, with inspirations drawn from Viking music, the Main Theme, Nordic culture, and – of course – heavy metal.
