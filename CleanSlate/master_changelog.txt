Global events no longer have to rely on the Pope, freeing mods up to disable the Papacy. Instead, use the 'pulse_province' flag, set on a random land province at first game start-up. For example, in your event trigger, check for the following, to ensure it can only fire once, or use 'has_flag = pulse_province' as a pre-trigger for a province_event:

 - character events: owns = event_target:pulse_province
 - province events:  has_flag = pulse_province

Reworked 'abdicate_holy_order_if_religion_changes_effect', in conjuction with 'setup_holy_order_religion_scopes' (new, called on_startup) and 'immediate'-clause in event SoA.4200. Update these when adding new religions and/or holy orders. 'abdicate_holy_order_if_religion_changes_effect' is now only called when a holy order leader changes religion, rather than all over the place

Rubbish 'old religion'-system is gone, saving several thousand lines of script. Instead, in events that may lead to a character converting, while keeping their old religion secretly, save the current religion before conversion in a persistent event target, named 'old_religion)'. See event 39700 (religious_events.txt), events SoA.4021, SoA.4024, SoA.4031 and SoA.4032 (soa_heresy_events.txt) as well as event MNM.3949 (mnm_secret_religious_societies_events.txt)

Added missing message types:

 - ASK_TO_EMBARGO_INTERACTION_DECLINE



= Decisions =

Ensured all decisions have only one ai_target_filter
Deleted duplicate decision 'stable_attribute_improvement_self_decision' - 'stable_attribute_improvement_decision' contains all the necessary functionality
Made triggers to form/vassalize holy orders much more consistent
Various 'create kingdom' decisions are much more consistent in triggers and effects
Various holy order decisions are much more consistent
Added missing remove_province_modifier effects to 'secret_religions_personally_adopt_secret_religion'
Merged all seven devil worshipper recruit decisions into one, added required customizable localisation

Renamed internal IDs:
 - catholic_pilgrimage -> christian_pilgrimage
 - prisoner_to_oubilette -> prisoner_to_oubliette



= Council voting =

Added council voting localisation for all vanilla interactions



= Events =

Moved misplaced end of event chain to married_life_events.txt
Moved most of guardian_events into childhood_personality_trait_events, because event chains shouldn't jump back and forth between two files
Merged events for arriving at Crusade/Jihad/GHW
Merged all Crusade/Jihad/GHW announcement events
Changed all 'capable_only' pre-triggers to 'only_capable', for consistency
Moved triggers to pre-triggers wherever possible
Consolidated all copy-paste holy order event chains (including Charlemagne DLC events), eliminating many inconsistencies
Eliminated all useless ping events
Ensured event triggers are satisfied in various event tombolas
Converted as many MTTH as possible to on_action events
The following events are no longer MTTH events, with the chances of the events occuring carefully calibrated to roughly match the originals:
 - Summer Fair
 - Grand Hunt
 - Republic Trade
 - Nerge Feast

Removed these obsolete events:
 - MNM.10025	- converts old secret religion traits into attribute
 - ZP.5			- converts old pet traits into modifiers



= Landed titles =

Separated landed titles per de jure empire, as well as religious heads, holy orders, mercenary bands, special titles, etc.
