is_quest_target = yes				# Scope must be a character, landed title or province, and returns true if the current scope is targetted by any quest
is_quest_target_of = character		# Scope must be a character, landed title or province, and returns true if the current scope is targetted by any quest
									# the character has
has_any_quest = yes					# Scope must be a character, return true if scoped character has one or more quests
has_quest = quest_name				# Scope must be a character, return true if scoped character has a quest with the given quest_name
