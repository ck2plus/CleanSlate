Wonders are buildings that players need to invest a lot of resource and time into, but they are very powerful. They are built in four successive stages. Each stage may unlock new slots in which the player may construct upgrades.

scopes: ROOT is the character, FROMFROM is the wonder, FROMFROMFROM is the province

Wonder syntax:
<wonder_name> = {						# The unique identifier of the wonder type. For example pyramid, great_library.
	picture = GFX_wonder_cathedral		# The gfx entry to use for this wonder
	default_picture_stage = 3			# Decides which frame of the wonder image strip frames should be displayed for GUI places
										# where there doesn't already exist a wonder
										# (such as the construction and construction confirmation views)
										# Can be set to 0 to get the damaged state
	model = wonder_pyramid				# The 3D model used for this wonder

	is_in_water = yes					# Is the wonder placed in water? Will override province terrain graphics with water background.
	allow_coastal = no					# Forbids construction in coastal provinces
	allow_construction = no				# Forbids construction under all circumstances, used for historical wonders
	show_model = no						# Hides 3D model, for underground wonders, etc.

	background_override = {				# Define how terrain types affect the background sprite
