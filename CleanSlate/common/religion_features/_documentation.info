This feature was introduced in 3.0/Holy Fury, and is used for reforming religions.

This folder is used to define what features can be chosen, and what those features do.

== Structure ==

For the purposes of scopes, by "religion", the documentation means "the religion resulting from this reformation". E.G., if the player is norse_pagan, the "religion" is norse_pagan_reformed.
When religions are randomized in alternate start, the actual on-map religion will be the scope. E.G., when norse_pagan gets randomized, the scope will be norse_pagan, not norse_pagan_reformed.

religion_nature = {							# Name of the feature category. This loc key will be used for its name,
											# and it plus "_desc" for its description.
											# The key plus "_feature" will be used in the religion feature list, if defined

	buttons = { nature }					# A list of buttons that pick from this category.
											# Need to be defined as windows within the religion_reformation_view window.
											# The window needs the elements "label", "picture", and "feature_label"

	religion_peaceful = {					# Name of a feature
		picture = GFX_pick_era_image_1		# What image to use for the feature
		potential = {						# When the feature will show in the UI. ROOT is the religion, FROM is the reformer
			always = yes
		}
		trigger = {							# When the feature can be picked. ROOT is the religion, FROM is the reformer
			always = yes
		}
		effect = {							# What effects it will have. ROOT is the religion, FROM is the reformer
			set_pacifist = yes
		}
		ai_will_do = {						# The chance the AI will pick a given option when reforming its religion.
											# Also used in the UI for generating the starting choices for the player.
											# Note that when hitting "randomize", no weighting is applied whatsoever.
											# Note that if you don't define this, the chance will be considered "1"

			factor = 10						# Base chance
			modifier = {					# ROOT is the religion, FROM is the reformer
				factor = 2
				always = yes
			}
		}
	}
	religion_blah_blah = {					# Name of another feature. Any number of features can be defined
		...
	}
}

You can extend a category from another file by simply using its name again. Useful for adding more doctrines or similar on top of what vanilla provides.
E.G.,
religion_nature = {
	some_new_doctrine = {
		blah blah blah
	}
}
Would result in "some_new_doctrine" getting added to the "religion_nature" category.

Be aware that FROM might not exist; in Alternate Start, if religion features are randomized there will not be a reformer specified.

	add_intermarry							# Used with another religion as target. E.G., add_intermarry = ROOT/catholic.
											# Can also be used with groups. Adds it to both religions
	remove_intermarry						# Used with another religion as target. E.G., remove_intermarry = ROOT/catholic.
											# Can also be used to remove groups. Removes it from both religions
	clear_intermarry						# Removes all intermarrying. Does not affect other religions
	set_defensive_attrition
	set_female_temple_holders
	set_male_temple_holders
	set_branch_tag							# Sets the branch tag of the religion, which is used for generating religious branch traits.
											# Normally, these would be the name of a religion, but now they can be custom instead.
											# E.G., "set_branch_tag = tag_name" will cause members of this religion
											# to choose a branch trait from the traits tagged with that tag name
	set_allows_matrilineal_marriage

The following effects only affect religion reformation:
	make_reformer_head_of_religion = yes	# Causes the person reforming to get the religion head title.
											# Note that the controlling title *must* be defined in landed titles for this to work.
											# If "no", it'll be given to a bishop or randomly generated character instead
	set_no_head_of_religion = yes			# Causes no religious head at all to be created, like the Indian religions

== Related triggers ==
has_religion_feature = feature_name			# Checks if the scoped religion (or character or so on; anything with a religion) has the given feature
has_selected_religion_feature = feature_name # Checks if the reformer has selected the given feature; can be used to make features mutually exclusive.
											# Works in any scope, but *only* works in religious feature triggers;
											# you risk OOS and similar if you try to use it elsewhere.
											# Use "has_religion_feature" instead. Note that when the player is replacing a selected feature by clicking it,
											# it is *not* considered selected, allowing them to replace it with a mutually exclusive feature
