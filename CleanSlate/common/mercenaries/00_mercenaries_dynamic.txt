# CleanSlate:
# 'levy_size' does not work for mercenaries created in script
# Dynamically created mercenary bands either specify a composition directly
# or refer to a base_title, which then depends on its holder's government.

# For nomads, uses one of the compositions below,
# corresponding to the culture of whoever holds the referenced base_title
# with culture having priority over culture group, falling back on default_culture_band_composition
# All numbers in the composition are multiplied by the holder's manpower/1000

# For all other government types, the composition will be a percentage
# of the total demesne troops of the holder of the referenced base_title
# as specified under 'levy_size' in the 'maintining_mercenary_band' static modifier
# i.e. 'levy_size = -0.025' will send 2.5% of all demesne troops to the new band

# Must exist or else dynamic mercenary band might fail for nomads!
