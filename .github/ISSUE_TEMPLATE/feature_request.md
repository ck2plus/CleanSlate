**Why should this exist?**  
(What problem does it solve? What pain point or limitation does it address?)

---

#### Possible Implementation Ideas
(If you have thoughts on *how* this could work, describe them here.  
Code references, event names, or design notes are welcome.)

---

#### Scope & Impact
- Is this purely a **bugfix / QoL improvement**, or does it **change gameplay behavior**?  
- Does it require **new content** (e.g., decisions, traits, events)?  
- Would it affect **save compatibility**?  

---

#### Additional Context

**Note:** CleanSlate focuses exclusively on bugfixes, code cleanup, and vanilla-intent preservation.  
Requests for new mechanics or gameplay overhauls fall outside the project’s scope and will be closed.
