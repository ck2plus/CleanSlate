Ensured pilgrimages to Saints will end on imprisonment
Running away from a bear in HF.41370 no longer ends the pilgrimage

Global events no longer have to rely on the Pope, freeing mods up to disable the Papacy. Instead, use the 'pulse_province' flag, set on a random province at first game start-up. For example, in your event trigger, check for the following, to ensure it can only fire once, or use 'has_flag = pulse_province' as a pre-trigger for a province_event:

owns = event_target:pulse_province

or

has_flag = pulse_province

Reworked 'abdicate_holy_order_if_religion_changes_effect', in conjuction with 'setup_holy_order_religion_scopes' (new, called on_startup) and 'immediate'-clause in event SoA.4200. Update these when adding new religions and/or holy orders. 'abdicate_holy_order_if_religion_changes_effect' is now only called when a holy order leader changes religion, rather than all over the place

Rubbish 'old religion'-system is gone, saving several thousand lines of script. Instead, in events that may lead to a character converting, while keeping their old religion secretly, save the current religion before conversion in a persistent event target, named 'old_religion)'. See event 39700 (religious_events.txt), events SoA.4021, SoA.4024, SoA.4031 and SoA.4032 (soa_heresy_events.txt) as well as event MNM.3949 (mnm_secret_religious_societies_events.txt)
